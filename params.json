{"name":"Probability","body":"# Probability [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ariejan/probability.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ariejan/probability)\r\n\r\nProbability gives you an easy way to perform code only every so\r\noften, based on your input.\r\n\r\nThis is great for testing purposes or in games.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'probability'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install probability\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nUsage is pretty simple. Let's say you want to get a 33% chance at something.\r\nThis means a 3 out of 10 (or 33 out of 100) chance.\r\n\r\n    3.in(10) => true    # About 33% of the time\r\n    3.in(10) => false   # About 67% of the time\r\n\r\nYou may also supply a block, which is only executed when the \r\nprobability conditions is true.\r\n\r\n    3.in(10) do\r\n      puts \"w00t - 33% chance and I got it!\"\r\n    end\r\n\r\nProbability uses SecureRandom in ruby-1.9 to generate random values.\r\n\r\n## Running specs\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/ariejan/probability.git\r\n    $ bundle install\r\n    $ rake spec\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5.
